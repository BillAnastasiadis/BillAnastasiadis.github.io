          The User Story  Working at SUSE as a software engineer, I came across Progress, which is a Redmine-based backlog tool. While it does, for all means and purpuses, serve it&amp;rsquo;s job as a backlog tracker pretty well, in a modern, agile dev team, there are elevated needs that Progress (as well as other issue-tracking programs) does not meet out of the box.
What kind of needs? Well, that depends on the team.
